Christmas in Sweden is not like in Poland.

On the day of Saint Lucia somebody dresses up as Saint Lucia and wakes
everybody up by singing Lucia songs.

Sweden don't have Santa Claus on Mikolaj, instead he comes christmas eve,
knocking on the door and asking "Are there any nice children here?" and
giving them presents.

He rides on a goat or a raindeer.

For christmas dinner there is a table full of food, where you pick a little
bit of everything you like. There is a big ham, many kinds of herring and of
course meatballs. We eat a lot of fish, but not carp.

Swedish food is very similar to Polish food but instead of Bigos there is
Pyttipanna, which is similar but with potatoes instead of cabbage. We also
have meatballs and many types of herring.

Sweden is a very tall country. The south is close to Poland and has almost the
same weather, but in the north there are very short summers and long cold
winters.

Up in the top of Sweden, around midsummer the sun never goes down, and around
christmas, the sun never goes up.

There are often beautiful lights in the sky, called "Northern lights".

Sweden is the home of Vikings, a people that would both trade and fight all
over Europe. They were body guard of the emperor of Byzantium, conquered
England, and founded Russia.

Poland and Sweden has a lot of history together. We even once had the same
king, Zygmunt. He came from Sweden and was elected the king of Poland because
his mother was a Polish princess who married a Swedish King.
